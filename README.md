## This is my solution for PyHackthon hosted by Jain Online :

### Task : Voice Assistance 


### Features --> 
  #### Voice Activity Detection : Instead of using a VAD model / voice classification model , I implemented a simple VAD 
  ##### It replies on only "Assistant" yu can change it as well.

  #### Speech to Tect : I employed Speech recognization library .
  ##### I can also use streamlit_mic_recorder 


  #### LLM : So for the inference im using Groq (llama model) 

  #### Text to Speech :
  ##### I'm using Coqui/your_TTS model which is a light weight model for TTS 
  ##### it can also do voice cloning 



### Future Work -->
  ### Realtime Avatar Talking .
  ### Optimzed models for STT / VAD / TTS like faster_whisper , Bark , silerio etc 
  ### Optimzed for Edge Devices .


## iNFERENCE-->
  ### Just run the cells one by one from the ipynb file.
  ### ngrok api key 
  ### Groqcloud api key
